states of promises=> 1.pending: it's still working on it
                     2.Fulfilled: it succeeded,and gave a result
                     3.Rejected: it failed, and gave an error
 ex code:
         let promise = new promise ((resolve,reject)=>
         {
            let success=true;

            if (success){
                resolve("it worked!");
            }else{
                reject("it failed");
            }
         });
         promise.then((result)=>{
            console.log(result); //when resolved
         })
         .catch((error)=>{
            console.log(error); //when Rejected
         })
